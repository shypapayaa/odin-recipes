      <h2>Bacalhau à Brás, a typically Portuguese dish loved by many people all around the country. It consists of cod, one of the most used fished in Portuguese cooking, along with thinly cut potatoes, eggs and onions.</h2>
      <p>In order to make this deliciously flavorful dish, the first step is thinly slicing onions and throwing them in the pan along with some olive oil to caramelize and sauteé the onions. If the codfish being used is already cooked, then all we have to do is just remove the skin and bones and shred it into small pieces. If the cod is raw, it must be thrown into a pan of boiling water in order to cook. </p>
      <p>The next steps of our recipe consist of adding the shredded cod to the onions and letting it sit for a bit so the cod can absorb some of the onion flavored olive oil. Next, thinly sliced toothpick potatoes should be added and the mixture should sit while we whisk some eggs. The eggs can then be added to the pan and everything should be mixed and allowed to cook. Top it off with some freshly cut parsley and black olives. Serve immediately. Enjoy!</p>
